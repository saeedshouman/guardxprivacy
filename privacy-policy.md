# 🔒 Privacy Policy — GuardX
**App Name:** **GuardX**  
**Developer:** AndroTech  

---

## 1. Introduction
GuardX (“we”, “our”, “the app”) is a privacy-focused mobile application designed to protect users from harmful or unwanted websites by filtering internet connections locally on the device.

Your privacy is our top priority. GuardX does **not** collect, store, or share any personal data.

---

## 2. Data Collection & Usage
### We do **NOT** collect any personal information.
GuardX does **NOT** collect:

- Browsing history  
- DNS queries  
- IP addresses  
- Device information  
- Location  
- Personal data  
- Contacts, messages, photos, or any private files  
- Advertising identifiers  

All processing happens **locally on your device**.

---

## 3. How GuardX Works
GuardX uses Android’s official **VpnService API** to filter internet traffic on-device. Filtering is used for:

- Blocking harmful or adult websites  
- Blocking ads or trackers  
- Allowing user-defined blocklists and whitelists  

GuardX performs all filtering **locally** and does **not** send, store, or process traffic externally.

---

## 4. Third-Party DNS Providers
GuardX uses public DNS resolvers selected by the user, and these DNS resolvers are **public and free**.  
GuardX does **not** send data to any third-party other than standard DNS queries handled directly by your device.

---

## 5. VPN Permission
GuardX requires the official Android VPN permission to function:

```
android.permission.BIND_VPN_SERVICE
```

This permission allows local traffic filtering only.  
GuardX does **not** route traffic to external servers and does not monitor or capture your activity.

---

## 6. Custom Blocklists & Whitelists
Users may manually add domains to:

- Blocklist  
- Whitelist  

These entries are saved **locally** and never uploaded.  
You may remove them anytime.

---

## 7. Security Features
GuardX supports optional security features:

- PIN Lock  
- Biometric Authentication  

PINs and biometric data are handled securely via Android APIs.  
GuardX does **not** store or transmit this data.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy
GuardX is designed to help protect families and children.  
The app collects **no data** from children or any users.

---

## 9. Your Rights
Because GuardX does not collect or store personal data:

- There is no user data to access, modify, or delete.  
- Uninstalling the app deletes all settings stored locally.

---

## 10. Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy to comply with Google Play policies or improve clarity.  
Updates will be posted on GitHub or inside the app.
